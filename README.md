# STUDENT-RESULT-ANALYSIS USING PYTHON



**Overview:**
This project delves into the analysis of student results, extracting valuable insights to understand the factors influencing academic performance. Leveraging Python's data analysis tools, the project performs ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) on a dataset sourced from Kaggle. It explores various aspects such as gender distribution, parental education impact, parental marital status influence, study time allocation, sports engagement, sibling effect, and ethnic group divisions.

**Language and Libraries Required:**

**Language:**
- Python

**Libraries:**
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn


**Prerequisites:**
- Dataset from Kaggle (Student Result Dataset)
- - Jupyter Notebook

**Analysis Highlights:**

**1. Data Preprocessing:**
- Extracted the dataset from Kaggle.
- Checked for data types, null values, top values, and bottom values in the dataset.
- Dropped the unnamed column to clean the data.

**2. Gender Distribution Analysis:**
- Plotted graphs to visualize the distribution of students based on gender.

**3. Parental Education Impact:**
- Explored the impact of parental education levels on student performance through visualizations.

**4. Parental Marital Status Influence:**
- Investigated how parental marital status affects students' academic performance using graphical representations.

**5. Study Time Allocation Analysis:**
- Analyzed the correlation between study time allocation and academic performance.

**6. Sports Engagement Impact:**
- Explored the relationship between total hours spent on playing sports and student education using visualizations.

**7. Sibling Effect Analysis:**
- Investigated whether having siblings affects students' academic performance and identified the impact based on the number of siblings.

**8. Ethnic Group Division:**
- Divided students into ethnic groups and examined their academic performance trends.
